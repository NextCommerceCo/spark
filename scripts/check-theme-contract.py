"""Assert a theme still carries the integration points Spark declares.

Spark-derived store themes never update from this repo, so a fix that lands
here does not reach them. The failures this gate targets are silent: the
storefront renders, the dashboard shows the app installed and enabled, and only
the events go missing. Nothing surfaces it until someone looks.

Two modes:

    check-theme-contract.py                       # a working copy, before push
    check-theme-contract.py --store ... --theme-id N   # a live theme, after it

The remote mode is the one that matters. A store carries several theme copies,
and republishing an old one silently undoes a patch applied to the active theme.

Every requirement carries a scope. `fleet` binds every Spark-derived theme and
is what the live check enforces by default; `spark` binds Spark's own working
copy only, because derived themes are forks that may carry the same hook in a
different file. Local mode checks both by default (it is Spark's CI gate);
`--scope` overrides either default. A live check of Spark's own copy (a dev
store, not a fork) therefore needs `--scope spark` to run the same rules the
working-copy check did.
